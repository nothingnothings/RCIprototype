# Webpack Multi-Page Project

This project is a simple multi-page web application built with Webpack. It was inspired by the site [RCIIT](https://www.rciit.com/) but developed independently by me, with original markup and styles. The primary goal of this project was to practice Bootstrap class usage and to showcase an example of basic structure that can be used for webpack projects.


## Features

- **Multi-Page Structure**: The project includes seven distinct pages.
- **Responsive Design**: Bootstrap was used for the responsive layouts, with mobile-first in mind.
- **JavaScript Functionality**: Javascript was used for the sidebar and the Carousels.
- **Webpack Configuration**: The project was bundled with webpack, its contents deployed and served[here](https://nothingnothings.github.io/bootstrapTraining/)


## Technologies Used


- **Webpack**: For module bundling.
- **HTML Webpack Plugin**: To generate HTML files for each page.
- **Sass**: For styling and creating responsive designs.
- **Bootstrap**: To leverage pre-built styles and components.

# BootstrapTraining

This project is a simple multi-page web application built with Webpack. It was inspired by the site [RCIIT](https://www.rciit.com/) but developed independently by me, with original markup and styles. The primary goal of this project was to practice Bootstrap class usage and to showcase an example of a basic structure that can be used for webpack projects. The project can be visited here: [https://nothingnothings.github.io/bootstrapTraining/](https://nothingnothings.github.io/bootstrapTraining/)


## Features

- **Multi-Page Structure**: The project includes seven distinct pages.
- **Responsive Design**: Bootstrap was used for the responsive layouts, with mobile-first in mind.
- **JavaScript Functionality**: Javascript was used for the sidebar and the Carousels.
- **Webpack Configuration**: The project was bundled and structured with webpack in mind,.


## Technologies Used
